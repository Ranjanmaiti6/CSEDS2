        <h1>Global Warming</h1>
        <p id="global">As ocean temperatures rise, corals experience stress and expel the algae (zooxanthellae) that provide them with energy and colour. This process, known as coral bleaching, leaves corals white and highly vulnerable to disease, starvation, and eventual death. Widespread bleaching events have been reported across the world, often linked to prolonged periods of unusually warm water.
        </p>
        
    <p id="result">Bleaching doesn’t necessarily mean immediate death, but prolonged bleaching without recovery time between events can lead to massive coral mortality, leaving entire reef systems barren and lifeless. This has ripple effects on marine biodiversity, as reefs provide shelter and food for countless marine species.

        Threats To Coral Reefs Climate Pollution Raja Ampat
    Ocean Acidification
    As the atmosphere absorbs more CO2, the ocean absorbs a significant portion of it, leading to ocean acidification. Increased CO2 reduces the pH of seawater, making it more acidic. This affects coral’s ability to build and maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, which are essential for their structure and growth. Weakened coral skeletons mean that reefs are more vulnerable to physical damage from storms and less capable of recovering from other environmental stresses.

    <p id="ocean">
        Ocean acidification also impacts the broader ecosystem by affecting shell-forming organisms, which are crucial to the marine food chain, further disrupting the balance of reef ecosystems.

        Sea Level Rise:
    Sea level rise, driven by melting polar ice caps and the thermal expansion of seawater, impacts coral reefs in multiple ways. Healthy reefs may grow vertically to keep pace with rising seas, but factors like sedimentation from coastal erosion and increased wave action can smother and stress corals. These stressors, combined with other climate-related challenges such as ocean warming, can inhibit coral growth and survival.
